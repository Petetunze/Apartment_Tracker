# Final Project : Apartment_Tracker
Final Project: AIS Computer Science

Objective: Write a program for a final grade for AIS with team mates. Program has to work, implement as much as as a student knows, and solve a "realistic" problem.

Project was written in collaboration with 4 other colleagues.
My team and I chose to write a program that aids in apartment hunting.
With a two week deadline, we did as much as we could efficiently.
Program was written by: Sebastian, Andrea, Aiman, and Ralph.

The outline of the project was simple. 
We each get equal amount of work depending on our knowledge of Java.
I offered to be the leader of the group and my colleagues agreed.
I split the work evenly, made sure every one understood their role, and made sure they got it done.
Over the course of two weeks, we made very good progess.
We communicated via Discord for any questions regarding the project and for updates.
At the end of the course, we sumbitted it and got full marks for the project.

Note: The original creation of this idea was in Fall of 2021. I refactored the code, added more features, fixed bugs, and added more quality of life improvments. 

Program Outline:

The program helps a user keep track of apartment information.
It can save the apartment name, rent, star rating, and any notes the user may have.
Users can add, delete, modify, list, print information, sort apartments, and exit the program. 

The program has 5 files.
- Main : Where the while loop is to keep the program running.
- functions : Main functions such as add, delete, sort.
- modify : Sub file to house all the modify functions for an apartment.
- sortBy : Sub file to house all the sorting functions for the apartment list.
- apartment : The apartment class. Holds the function to make an apartment object and all compatators to handle sorting.
